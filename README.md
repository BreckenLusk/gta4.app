Niko Bellic, Johnny Klebitz, and Luis Lopez all have one thing in common – they live in the worst city in America.  
  
Liberty City is a very different place in the 21st century. The most famous skyline in the world now belies a city gripped by fear and suspicion. In the shadow of an uncertain economy and the threat of terrorism, organized criminals, corrupt officials, and beleaguered security forces vie for supremacy in a city that is desperately trying to become a suburb. It is still a place where anything is possible, depending on how much of yourself you are prepared to sacrifice in the process. Liberty City worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don’t. 
  
Niko is looking to escape his past and make a new life for himself in the land of opportunity. Johnny, a veteran member of The Lost biker gang, is caught in the middle of a vicious turf war with rival gangs for control of the city. Luis, part-time hoodlum and full-time assistant to legendary nightclub impresario Tony Prince (a.k.a. “Gay Tony”), is struggling with the competing loyalties of family and friends in a world in which everyone has a price. Their lives cross paths with devastating consequences as they fight to survive in a city torn apart by violence and corruption.  
  
  
Rockstar Games brings its biggest release to mobile yet with a vast open-world covering the State of Liberty and its major city, Liberty City, with enhanced visual fidelity and over 80 hours of gameplay.
